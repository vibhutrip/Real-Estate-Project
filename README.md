Determine the prices of Property based in Australia 
Since the response or target varaible is a continuous one hence Regression Algorithm would have to be used. I used Linear Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest for the same.

As most of us know Price of a Property is one of the most important decision criterion when people buy homes. Real state firms need to be consistent in their pricing in order to attract buyers . Having a predictive model for the same will be great tool to have , which in turn can also be used to tweak development of properties , putting more emphasis on qualities which increase the value of the property.


As usual Random Forest was able to provide the best results(the best RSME score among all three algorithms). There was almost no difference in RSME scores of Linear Regression or Decision Trees.

Following Variables/Features were considered to determine the Prices of Property
Suburb, Address,	Rooms,	
Type(type of the property agricultural property, commercial , residential etc),
Method(method for selling)	
SellerG(Name of the Seller)
Distance(distance from the city center)	
Postcode	
Bedroom2(numbers of secondary bedrooms)
